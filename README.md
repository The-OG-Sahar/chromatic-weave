# chromatic-weave
A generative art tool that weaves unique digital tapestries with algorithms.

✨ About

Chromatic Weave is an exploration into the beautiful intersection of code and creativity. I wanted to prove that algorithms could be more than just logic they could be a paintbrush.

With a single click, the app generates a completely unique, abstract piece of art. It uses randomized parameters for color, line thickness, and bezier curve paths to create a complex, layered "digital tapestry." No two pieces are ever the same. You can also download your creation as a high-quality PNG image.
 🚀 Getting Started

Want to run it yourself? It's incredibly easy! There are no API keys or servers to set up.

Prerequisites
Just a modern web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Safari).

**Installation:**
1.  Clone this repository to your local machine.
   
    git clone https://github.com/the-og-sahar/chromatic-weave.git
    
2.  Navigate into the project directory.
    
    cd chromatic-weave
    
3.  Open the `art.html` file in your favorite web browser.

That's it! You can now start generating your own generative art.

 🛠️ Built With

This project was created with a simple and powerful front-end stack:

[HTML5](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/HTML5)** - The basic structure of the page.
[CSS3](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)** & **Tailwind CSS** - For clean, modern styling.
[JavaScript (ES6+)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)** - The core logic.
[p5.js](https://p5js.org/)** - The powerful creative coding library that makes the magic happen.

 🔮 What's Next?

I have a lot of ideas to take Chromatic Weave even further:

User-Defined Palettes: Allow users to create and save their own color palettes.
More "Weave" Patterns:Introduce different generative patterns, like particle systems or geometric shapes.
  Subtle Animations:Add a gentle, breathing animation to the tapestries to bring them to life.
    gh-Resolution Export:An option to generate art in much higher resolutions for printing.
